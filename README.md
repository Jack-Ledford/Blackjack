# Blackjack
This is my first Java project.
The goal is to make a working blackjack game with the normal casino rules and a working bet amount.
Ideally I want a GUI (Swing?) to be able to make this work, but if there is a better option reach out.
The BlackJack file was a first attempt, only working in the terminal and it isn't 100% complete.
